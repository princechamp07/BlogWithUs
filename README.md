# React + Vite

This template offers a minimal setup for utilizing React in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and certain ESLint rules.

## Before Starting

Before beginning, please ensure that you have the JSON server running. If you haven't started it yet, please follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Start the JSON server by running the following command:
   
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
   ```

   This command assumes that you have a `db.json` file in your project directory, which contains your JSON data.

## Official Plugins

This template integrates two official plugins:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This plugin utilizes Babel for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This plugin uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

For more information on these plugins and their usage, please refer to their respective documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the Vite development server and open your default browser with the project running. Any changes made to your React components or other files will be hot-reloaded automatically.
